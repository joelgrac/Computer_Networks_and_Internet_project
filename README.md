Project developed in the context of the Computer Networks and Internet course, implementing a node of an NDN (Named Data Networking) network that allows creating, storing, and requesting data objects by name. Nodes communicate via TCP, forming a tree-like topology and dynamically managing their joining and leaving. The protocol includes interest, object, and no-object messages, with support for caching and forwarding. The application provides commands to manage the network, data objects, and to view the cache and the Pending Interest Table (PIT). Feat Rodrigo Pedrosa
